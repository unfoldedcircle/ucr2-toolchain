# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Found a bug, typo, something that could be improved or a description that doesn't make sense or needs clarification?
Great, please let us know!

### Pull Requests

**Any pull request needs to be reviewed and approved by the Unfolded Circle embedded team.**

⚠️ Due to the nature of the low level toolkit, which is tightly linked to the embedded Linux system running on the
device, we can't accept every pull request from the community. Please reach out to us first if you plan to make changes.

Submitting pull requests for typos, formatting issues etc. are happily accepted and usually approved relatively quick.  
For other things, please talk to us first!  
We are open to suggestions improving the toolchain build & packaging process. The preferred way for this type of changes
is to open a feature request or enhancement with your proposed changes, rather than directly submitting a pull request,
which we'll probably have to decline.
